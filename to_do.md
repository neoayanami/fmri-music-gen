## TO DO

0) Measure CLAP fine-tuned on music performances on genre classification [OK ceiling]
1) Improve the encoding model (use CLAP finetuned on music)              [TO DO - save models and correlations]

2) Study over time? There is a peak performance in the brain when listening to music? Instead of average classify using the time points [TO DO]

3) Study on the impact of the region chosen (repeat the analysis with smaller and larger regions, I would like to have a graph of identification accuracy in function of region size)                      [TO DO ] 
    3b) Maybe use an atlas based region? [?]

4) tSNE plot of music in the CLAP space [Make it nicer]
5) tSNE plot of music retrieved by the brain? [Maybe]
6) Confusion matrix to study what kind of genres are more misclassified 


7) Maybe also music? https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002722/versions/1.0.1
